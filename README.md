# ChatGpt Clone Using Google Gemini 

This repository contains the code for a chatbot that uses the Google Gemini API to generate responses to user input. The chatbot is built using the Streamlit library, and it allows users to interact with the chatbot in a web browser. The chatbot uses the GPT-3 model to generate responses to user input, and it can carry on a conversation with users on a wide range of topics.
